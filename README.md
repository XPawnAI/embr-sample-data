Medical data for Generative AI - [Click GPT-4o-Mini Summary Example](https://github.com/XPawnAI/embr-sample-data/blob/main/notebooks/patient-summary.ipynb)

### Details

- 100 synthetic patient records 
- Strcutured medical data that is token efficient for generative AI use
- All files are under 120,000 tokens for gpt-4o-mini 

> **Note**: This is a sample and not a complete dataset. Any code is for demonstration purposes only and not production ready.

### Quick Start For Python + OpenAI + EMBR

To get started, you'll need Python **3.11** and the OpenAI API Key.

#### Step 1
Using requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 2
Manually Update a `.env` file:
1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE` with your OpenAI API key

#### Step 3
Run the example scripts:
```bash
python example/summary.py
```

## Data

- **Synthetic Patient Records**: Each `.json` file contains a synthetic patient record generated by [Synthea's Patient Generator](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea), designed to reflect real-world healthcare data.

- **FHIR -> EMBR Conversion**: Each `.json` file is a compressed, token-efficient version of [FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir/) data, optimized for generative AI use without losing essential medical details. 





### Overview of EMBR

The **EMBR (Extracted Medical Bulk Reduction)** format is a custom data reduction approach tailored to healthcare applications, focusing on preserving clinically relevant information while minimizing data bulk. This repository provides a proof of concept for healthcare developers, AI researchers, and LLM engineers who want to leverage synthetic medical data for model training, evaluation, or as a reference resource in developing AI tools for healthcare.

### Why Use EMBR?

- **Token Efficiency**: EMBR files are structured to reduce token count, making them highly suitable for LLM applications where token limitations are a constraint.
- **Healthcare Context Specificity**: Designed for clinical use cases, this data mirrors the complexity of real-world patient records while ensuring privacy through synthetically generated information.
